1) A mixture of Bi(NO3)3 (cid:2) 5H2O (0.242 g, 0.5 mmol) or Bi2O3
(0.232 g, 0.5 mmol) and pyridine-2, 5-dicarboxylic acid (H2pydc)
(0.250 g, 1.5 mmol) in H2O (25 ml) was sealed in a Teﬂon-lined
autoclave and heated to a temperature of 180 1C for 3 day, and
then cooled slowly at 0.1 1C/min to room temperature. Colorless,
needle-like crystals were obtained in 90% yield (based on bismuth)
admixed with an unidentiﬁed white powder phase, which was
almost completely separated from the needle shaped crystals by
sieving. The products were washed with DMF to dissolve and
remove any unreacted ligand. The ﬁnal product was isolated by
vacuum ﬁltration. The isolated needle crystals were used for
structure and physical characterizations.

2) A mixture of Bi(NO3)3 (cid:2) 5H2O (0.242 g, 0.5 mmol) and an excess
of 1R3S-camphoric acid (1R3S-cam) (0.300 g, 1.5 mmol) and
NaOH (0.024 g, 0.6 mmol) in EtOH (25 ml) was sealed in a
Teﬂon-lined autoclave and heated to a temperature of 100 1C for
3 day, and then cooled slowly at 0.1 1C/min to room temperature.
Colorless, needle-shaped crystals and white polycrystalline
powder were obtained in quantitative yield based on bismuth.
The products were washed with DMF to dissolve and remove any
unreacted ligand. The ﬁnal product was isolated by vacuum
ﬁltration. It is this mixture of powder and needle crystals that
were used for structure and physical characterizations.

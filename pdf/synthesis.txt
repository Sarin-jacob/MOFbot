Three novel bismuth-based coordination polymers_ Synthesis_ structure and luminescent properties
1) A mixture of Bi(NO3)3 (cid:2) 5H2O (0.242 g, 0.5 mmol) or Bi2O3
(0.232 g, 0.5 mmol) and pyridine-2, 5-dicarboxylic acid (H2pydc)
(0.250 g, 1.5 mmol) in H2O (25 ml) was sealed in a Teﬂon-lined
autoclave and heated to a temperature of 180 1C for 3 day, and
then cooled slowly at 0.1 1C/min to room temperature. Colorless,
needle-like crystals were obtained in 90% yield (based on bismuth)
admixed with an unidentiﬁed white powder phase, which was
almost completely separated from the needle shaped crystals by
sieving. The products were washed with DMF to dissolve and
remove any unreacted ligand. The ﬁnal product was isolated by
vacuum ﬁltration. The isolated needle crystals were used for
structure and physical characterizations.

2) A mixture of Bi(NO3)3 (cid:2) 5H2O (0.242 g, 0.5 mmol) and an excess
of 1R3S-camphoric acid (1R3S-cam) (0.300 g, 1.5 mmol) and
NaOH (0.024 g, 0.6 mmol) in EtOH (25 ml) was sealed in a
Teﬂon-lined autoclave and heated to a temperature of 100 1C for
3 day, and then cooled slowly at 0.1 1C/min to room temperature.
Colorless, needle-shaped crystals and white polycrystalline
powder were obtained in quantitative yield based on bismuth.
The products were washed with DMF to dissolve and remove any
unreacted ligand. The ﬁnal product was isolated by vacuum
ﬁltration. It is this mixture of powder and needle crystals that
were used for structure and physical characterizations.

3) Hpy[Bi(TDC)2(H2O)]·1.5H2O (1)  
An aliquot of a 0.0267 M solution of bismuth nitrate in glacial acetic acid (1.5 mL, 0.04 mmol), 
an aliquot of a 0.2 M solution of H2TDC in ethanol (1.5 mL, 0.3 mmol), and pyridine (40 µL, 0.5 
mmol)    were  loaded  into  a  10  mL  glass  vial  (pHi    ≈  4-5).  An  opaque,  white  suspension  was 
initially observed upon addition of the reactants. The vial was capped and left on the benchtop at 
room  temperature.  After  five  to  seven  days,  crystallization  was  observed  (pHf    ≈  5-6).  The 
products  were  filtered,  washed  in  water  and  ethanol,  and  allowed  to  air  dry.  Large  colorless 
plates of 1 were collected. Yield: 94% (based on Bi). Elemental Analysis: Calc. (Obs.): C, 30.27 
(30.26);  H,  2.25  (2.18);  N,  2.08,  (2.13  %).  Raman  1  ῦ  =  1528,  1479,  1400,1315,  1202,  1124, 
1009, 835, 392 cm-1.

4) Hpy[Bi1-xLnx(TDC)2(H2O)]·1.5H2O (Bi1-xLnx-1)  
The  syntheses  follow  that  of  compound  1.  After  2  days,  an  aliquot  of  an  aqueous  0.025M 
lanthanide nitrate solution (167 µL, 0.00417 mmol) was added to the glass vial which contained 
a white suspension. After five to seven additional days, the solution was clear and colorless, and 
colorless crystals had deposited at the bottom of the vial. The products were filtered, washed in 
water  and  ethanol,  and  allowed  to  air  dry.  Clear,  colorless plates  of  Bi1-xLnx-1  were  observed. 
Yield:  80-90%  (based  on  Bi).  Elemental  Analysis:  Ln=Nd,  Calc.  (Obs.):  C,  30.39  (30.43);  H, 
2.25  (2.29);  N,  2.06  (2.15%);  Ln=Sm,  Calc.  (Obs.):  C,  30.44  (30.31);  H,  2.25  (2.23),  N,  2.09, 
(2.14%); Ln=Eu, Calc. (Obs.): C, 30.29 (30.58); H, 2.24 (2.11); N, 2.08, (2.28%); Ln=Tb, Calc. 
(Obs.):  C,  30.29  (30.63);  H,  2.24  (1.76);  N,  2.08,  (2.05  %);  Ln=  Dy,  Calc.  (Obs.):  C,  30.32

N, 2.08, (2.20%).

5) [Bi0.99Eu0.01(TDC)2(HTDC)(Hpy)2](Bi0.99Eu0.01-3)  
The  syntheses  follow  that  of  2  and  3.  Two  days  after  capping  the  glass  vial,  an  aliquot  of  a 
0.025M europium nitrate solution (167 µL, 0.00417 mmol) was added to the reaction. After two 
more  days,  the  products  were  filtered,  washed  in  water  and  ethanol,  and  allowed  to  dry  under 
ambient  conditions.  Single  crystals  of 
the  europium  compound  Bi0.99Eu0.01-3  and  a 
nonluminescent, white, microcrystalline minor phase identified as undoped 2 (via PXRD) were 
present.  Bi0.99Eu0.01-3  could  be  identified  by  visual  inspection  under  a  UV  lamp  and  was 
manually separated from 2. Yield: 89% (based on Bi). Elemental Analysis: Ln=Eu, Calc. (Obs.): 
C, 38.00 (37.54); H, 2.14 (2.02); N, 3.17, (3.12). Note that because Bi0.99Eu0.01-3 was manually 
separated from 2 under a UV lamp, using the luminescence of Eu as a guide, we did not prepare 
the other Ln doped analogs.

6) [Eu(TDC)(NO3)(H2O)] (4)  
An aliquot of a 0.0267 M solution of europium nitrate in glacial acetic acid (1.5 mL, 0.04 mmol), 
an aliquot of a 0.2 M solution of H2TDC in ethanol (1.5 mL, 0.3 mmol), and pyridine (40 µL, 0.5 
mmol)  were  loaded  into  a  10  mL  glass  vial.  The  vial  was  capped  and  left  on  the  benchtop  at 
room temperature. Colorless crystals formed overnight  and deposited  at the bottom of the vial. 
The products were filtered, washed in water and ethanol, and allowed to air dry. Large colorless 
plates identified as 4 were collected. Though not readily apparent in the powder pattern, a minor 
phase  impurity  identified  via  elemental  analysis  precluded  subsequent  characterization  that 
required bulk purity (Fig. S9). Raman ῦ = 1546, 1476, 1405, 1325, 1217, 1131, 1033, 793, 760, 
680 cm-1.
